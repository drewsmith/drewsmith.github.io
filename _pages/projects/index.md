  <h2 class="underline">LeaningTowerOf.Pizza</h2>
  <p>
    A simple canvas JavaScript game I create with my 7 year old son to
    get him interested in coding. He dictated the features of the game and we talked through the code. The premise is there is a tower that is leaning (i.e. leaning tower of Pisa) that shoots falling pizza objects to receive points. When the objects collide with the tower, health is deducted.
